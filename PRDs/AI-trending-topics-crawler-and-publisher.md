#### 3. Output Formatting

- **JSON Output:**
  - Structure:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "title": "Brief summary of the topic",
        "sources": [
          "https://link1.com",
          "https://link2.com"
        ]
      },
      ...

    - [Source 1](https://link1.com)
    ...
    ```

#### 4. GitHub Integration

- **Repository:** Configurable target GitHub repo.
- **File Naming:** Use a timestamp or date for each markdown file (e.g., `ai-trends-2024-06-10.md`).
- **Commit Message:** Include date and a brief description (e.g., "Add AI trending topics for 2024-06-10").
- **Push:** Automatically push the commit to the main branch (or configurable branch).

---

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Automation:** The process should be fully automated and able to run on a schedule (e.g., daily).
- **Reliability:** Handle API failures or rate limits gracefully.
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add more sources or change output format in the future.
- **Security:** Secure handling of API keys and GitHub credentials.
